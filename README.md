# Book-Recommender-System

## Overview
The Book Recommender System is a machine learning project designed to suggest books to users based on their reading history and preferences. This system leverages collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques to provide personalized book recommendations.

## Features
- Personalized book recommendations
- User-based collaborative filtering
- Item-based collaborative filtering
- Content-based filtering
- Hybrid recommendation system

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Book-Recommender-System.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Book-Recommender-System
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. Prepare the dataset:
    - Ensure you have a dataset of books and user ratings.
    - Place the dataset in the `data/` directory.

2. Train the model:
    ```bash
    python train.py
    ```

3. Generate recommendations:
    ```bash
    python recommend.py --user_id <user_id>
    ```

## Dataset
The dataset should contain information about books and user ratings. You can use publicly available datasets such as the [Goodreads dataset](https://sites.google.com/eng.ucsd.edu/ucsdbookgraph/home) or the [Book-Crossing dataset](http://www2.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~cziegler/BX/).
